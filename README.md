This project is a fully responsive E-commerce Website built using modern web technologies and powered by a Fake API for product data, cart management, and dynamic content rendering. The website simulates a real online shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, view details, add items to the cart, and manage their checkout flow — all without requiring a real backend.

The Fake API (such as FakeStoreAPI, JSON-Server, or custom mock data) acts as a lightweight backend, enabling fast development and easy testing of frontend features.
